# DSCI-Stock-Predictor


Capstone 1 includes the Data Acquistion, Pre-Processing, and EDA of our project.  The project is in regards to predicting the movement in stock price based on the language of social media posts.  As seen we break down our folders into Code, Data, Reports, and the Presentation.  In Capstone 2, we continue our analysis and begin to apply different Machine Learning techniques and continue to finalize our dataset with new features.  With the Reports and Presentation being self explanatory, we will explain what is in the Code and Data Folders.

Code Folder:

	-   Additional Code = This folder includes pieces of code that were eventually compiled into the Project Code.
        - Twitter = Code enclosed has pipeline to gather twitter data using the cashtag ($GE). To use, add token to yaml file.

	-   4 Months Reddit Posts_Comments Combined = The first analysis included Reddit Posts and Stock data from 
	    January-April of 2020.  This code includes and Stock data from January-April of 2020.  This code includes 
	    Preprocessing and EDA.

	-   8 Mos and Post and Comments Separated = This folder includes analysis from October 2020-May 2021.  
	    In addition, the Posts and Comments in this analysis have been separated into their own objects 
	    in all Preprocessing and EDA.
	
	-   Machine Learning techniques performed on our data included a Random Forest Time Series approach, 
	    Support Vector Machines combined with the creation of a TF_IDF to be added as a feature.
	    
	 

Data Folder:

	-   Yahoo Finance = This folder has the Finance Data from our 4 companies we did analysis on over the 8 month 
	    time span.
	
	-   8_mos_DataFrame.csv = This file is our Compiled Data Frame with all of our features over 8 months, with
	    Posts and Comments Separated.  ***It is important to note, I think in Capstone 2, we should consider 
	    filtering out a fewer amount of comments (something we did). This will give us a plentiful amount of 
	    posts and comments if we want more.
	    
	-   Posts and Comments = This folder contains Data Objects that were written to Json Objects for easy 
	    retrieval, they include the Posts, Comments, and the Word Count Structures.  These objects are separated
	    into sub-folders, based on whether they were an analysis done when the Posts and Comments were all 
	    combined together, or whether it was an analysis done just on the posts or the comments.

    -   Twitter = Tweets using API for the four tickers (TSLA, GE, AMD, NVDA) between 01/2021 - 04/2021. Ranging between 200-2000 tweets a day
